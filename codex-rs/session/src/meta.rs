//! Rich on-disk session metadata envelope.
//!
//! The file is written as `meta.json` inside every session directory so users
//! (and other tools) can inspect how a particular session was started even
//! months later.  Keeping the full CLI invocation together with a few extra
//! bits of contextual information (like the git commit of the build) makes
//! debugging and reproducibility significantly easier.
