# manager_utils

This directory contains utility scripts to support the Project Manager agent.
Scripts here should automate common manager tasks (e.g. scanning branches for status,
checking for merge conflicts, proposing merges, conflict-resolution guidance,
polling loops, etc.).

Each script should include a short header explaining its purpose, usage examples,
and any dependencies.
