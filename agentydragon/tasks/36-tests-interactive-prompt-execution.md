> *This task is specific to codex-rs.*

## Status

**General Status**: Not started  
**Summary**: Follow-up to TaskÂ 13; add unit tests for interactive prompt overlay during execution.

## Goal

Write tests that verify `BottomPane::handle_key_event` forwards input to the composer while `is_task_running`, preserving the status overlay until completion.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Unit tests covering key events (e.g. alphanumeric, Enter) during `is_task_running == true`.
- Assertions that `active_view` remains a `StatusIndicatorView` while running and is removed when `set_task_running(false)` is called.
- Coverage of redraw requests and correct `InputResult` values.
