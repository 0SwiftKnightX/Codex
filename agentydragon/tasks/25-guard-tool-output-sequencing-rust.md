## Summary
Prevent out-of-order chat messages and missing tool output errors when user input interrupts tool execution in the Rust backend.

## Goal
Ensure the Rust server implementation sequences tool output and chat messages correctly. Add synchronization logic so that an in-flight tool invocation either completes or is cancelled before new messages are processed, avoiding "No tool output found" invalid_request errors.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The Rust message broker must detect pending tool invocations and pause delivery of subsequent user or model messages until the tool result or cancellation is handled.
- No panic or 400 Bad Request errors should occur due to missing tool output in edge cases of interrupted rollouts or mid-stream user input.
- Add Rust integration tests simulating tool invocation interruption and user message interleaving, verifying correct ordering and delivery.

## Implementation

We will implement the following high-level plan:

- Locate where the ChatCompletion request messages array is built in Rust:
  the `stream_chat_completions` function in `codex-rs/core/src/chat_completions.rs`.
- In that loop, track pending tool invocations by their call IDs when encountering `ResponseItem::FunctionCall` entries.
- Buffer any subsequent `ResponseItem::Message { role: "user" }` or new turn inputs until the matching `ResponseItem::FunctionCallOutput` (tool result) appears.
- Once the tool output is seen, flush buffered user messages in order immediately before continuing to build the next API call.
- Add tests under `codex-rs/core/tests/` (e.g. `guard_tool_output_sequencing.rs`) that exercise interleaved input sequences:
  - A user message mid-rollout before tool output, ensuring it is delayed until after the tool result.
  - Normal flow where no buffering is needed.
  - Cancellation paths (no tool output) inserting a fake "Tool cancelled" tool message and flushing buffered messages.
- Front-end layers automatically render the "Tool cancelled" message as a tool output, satisfying UI requirements.

this is a lot of the problem still happening

## Next Steps / Debugging

The above change did not resolve the issue. We need to gather more debug information to understand why missing tool output errors still occur.

Suggested approaches:
- Enable detailed debug logging in the Rust message broker (e.g. set `RUST_LOG=debug` or add tracing spans around function calls).
- Dump the sequence of incoming and outgoing `ResponseItem` events to a log file for offline analysis.
- Instrument timing and ordering by recording timestamps when tool invocations start, complete, and when user input is received.
- Write a minimal reproduction harness that reliably triggers the missing output error under controlled conditions.
- Capture full request/response payloads to/from the OpenAI API to verify whether the function output is delivered but not processed.
