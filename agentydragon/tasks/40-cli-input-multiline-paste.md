# Task 40: Support Multiline Paste in codex-rs CLI Input Window

> *This task is specific to codex-rs.*

## Acceptance Criteria

- When pasting multiline text into the codex-rs CLI input (REPL), newlines in the pasted text are inserted into the input buffer rather than causing premature command execution.
- The pasted content preserves original end-of-line characters and spacing.
- The user can still press Enter to submit the complete command when desired.
- Behavior for single-line input and manual line breaks remains unchanged.

## Implementation
**How it was implemented**  
Provide details on code modules, design decisions, and steps taken.  
*If this section is left blank or contains only placeholder text, the implementing developer should first populate it with a concise high-level plan before writing code.*

**How it works**  
Explain runtime behavior and overall operation.  
*If this section is left blank or contains only placeholder text, the implementing developer should update it to describe the intended runtime behavior.*

## Notes

- Investigate enabling bracketed paste support in the line-editing library used (e.g. rustyline, liner).
- Ensure that bracketed paste mode is enabled when initializing the CLI to distinguish between pasted content and typed input.
- Review how other REPLs implement multiline paste handling to inform the design.
