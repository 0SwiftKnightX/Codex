read the description of all tasks in agentydragon/tasks/*.md and relevant context in codex-rs. for every task: disregard existing dependecy declarations in the frontmatter. think long about
why and how they might depend on each other and if there's any way they might conflict and whether the overall picturen of how they fit toether makes sense. for each, *REGENERATE* the
dependency list in frontmatter to the list of tasks the muast be done before each gvien taks becomes unblocked. no need to populate this for already merged tasks. also no need to list
merged tasks inside any dependency list.
